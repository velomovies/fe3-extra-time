## Extra time

In this document I show how I spend the extra 20 hours for frontend 3. The most time is spend on research for the assessments and  assignments. Next to that I did get to learn my duck very well. Bellow you can see an extensive explanation of what I did.

## Spending my time (well?!)

For this course I spend my time on a few things. Below you can find a full list.

Before I started this course I had to get to know javascript again. In the last half year I didn't use any code. This because of a design intership and an holiday without working on code. The bootcamp of the first class did help me alot, but I wanted to be better prepared. 

For preparation of the class I did some research in javascripting. The research consisted of reviewing code I wrote earlier. I went over every line and looked if I understand everything. Next to that I read the important parts of the [You don't know JS](https://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Going/dp/1491924462) book.

# Where did my time go

Next to reading about code I wanted to learn D3 better. Before the class I didn't really know what to expect, but then it turned out to be more difficult then I thought. 

For the first assignments I did some research in D3 to learn the basics. A website I read was:

* [A D3 introduction](https://d3js.org/#introduction)

Next to this I read some code already wrote. The code I read was mostly of Mike Bostock.

# Assignment and Assessments

For the most part my extra time went into researching problems in my own code. I had the most problems with code that was already writen and I wanted to change. For that I went through the whole [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

# My duck

My extra time went ofcourse into talking to my duck. I wanted to know him better. And yes, **him**. He is named Yellow Beard. And you have to know how much he knows about code. And especially D3. 

With knowing him better it was easier to talk with him about code. Together with him I could conquer all assessments. He helped me the most with assessment 3.
